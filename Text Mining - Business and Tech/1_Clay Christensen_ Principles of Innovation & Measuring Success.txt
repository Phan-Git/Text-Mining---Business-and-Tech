I I'm an academic this is my second

career the first one was I built and ran

a company to make products out of

advanced materials my partners were MIT

professors the company has become quite

successful but I always had wanted to be

a teacher so as the company hit its

stride and I was hitting age 40 with the

support of a wonderful wife decided if I

was ever gonna be a teacher I better

start so I bailed out and become became

a doctoral student all over again it's

at age 40 with five kids it was stupid

in retrospect but I I'm glad in some

ways I that I I did it in this way

because I brought with me a set of

questions that I wouldn't have thought

about and I just stayed in academia for

my whole life

and one of the puzzles was gosh if you

look across the sweep of business

history most companies which at one

point were widely regarded as

unassailably successful a decade or two

later you find them in the middle of the

pack and often at the bottom of the heap

and I knew a lot of the people who ran

one point at one point successful

companies whose companies met their

demise and it just didn't feel right to

blame bad management for failure because

these are smart people and so I've been

studying this problem for now 20 years

what happens to successful companies and

it turns out that the root cause of much

of the problem is good management in

other words managers who do what would

we

teach them to do at the Harvard Business

School in places like this actually

cause you to run your companies into

oblivion so I want to just talk a little

bit about that and most of it I'm gonna

talk about your businesses there's a

piece where I want to talk about what's

going on in the overall economy which i

think is quite salient to some of the

problems that you face in innovation and

as I we do this I think I'll get down

off of this stage here because I'm six

feet eight and if I'm up here it

exacerbates the problem and I'd love to

just break occasionally and ask you to

throw comments or questions or create

cannonballs at me

so since none of you have made a lot of

steel yet in your lives I thought I'd

describe how this process of successful

companies following good management and

drive their companies over the cliff I'd

like to describe how this has happened

in the steel industry because there's a

general model that is emerged from this

piece of work and then I'd like to talk

about where else we see this is

happening including in yours so

historically there there are two ways to

make steel the dominant method was in

what we called an integrated steel

company that's in the upper left

companies like Bethlehem and US Steel to

build a new integrated steel mill would

cost about 10 billion dollars today the

other way to do it as I described in the

lower right is what we call a mini mill

and mini Mills melt scrap in electric

furnace

and you could put easily 12 electric

furnaces in this room and because you

can make molten steel in such a small

chamber they don't have to scale up the

downstream processing steps and that's

why they call these things mini mills

the most important dimension of a mini

mill is they can make steel of any given

quality in their mini mill for 20

percent lower cost than you can make it

in a big integrated mill so just think

about this for a minute imagine that you

were the CEO of an integrated steel

company somewhere in the world you're

making commodities here is a technology

mini mills that would reduce the full

cost of making this commodity by 20

percent don't you think you'd adopt this

new technology it's broadly available

and yet not a single integrated steel

company anywhere in the world has yet

built and operated a mini mill and this

is my sense for why something that makes

consummate sense is actually impossible

for smart people to do so the steel mill

like every meal what market is comprised

of tiers so at the very bottom of the

market is concrete reinforcing bar or

rebar youth all of us could make rebar

today if we wanted to but the high end

of the market is sheet that they used to

make appliances and cars very

complicated product and the margins go

increase as you go up that market at the

time of this story the integrated mills

were making the full range of these

products when the mini mills became

technologically viable in the late 1960

the quality of the steel they could

produce was really crummy because they

were melting scrap in these electric

furnaces

and the only market that would buy what

the mini-meals made was the rebar market

down at the bottom because there are

almost no specifications for rebar to

begin with and then once you buried it

inside of cement you couldn't verify

whether it had met spec or not and so

rebar was a perfect product for crummy

products as the mini mills attacked the

rebar market the integrated steel

company as you show on the left was

happy to get out of rebar as it truly

was a dog-eat-dog commodity their gross

margins were only 7% it made no sense to

defend a crummy 7% business when in

angle iron and thicker bar and rod the

margins were about 12% so an interesting

thing happened as they integrated steel

companies lopped off the lowest profit

part of their product line their gross

margins improved by getting out of rebar

the mini mills because they had a 20%

cost advantage they rolled tons of money

by getting into the business that the

integrated Mills got out of so they were

really quite happy one with another but

in 1979 that pact disappeared that was

the year when the mini Mills finally

succeeded in driving the last high cost

integrated player out of the rebar

market if you look at what happened to

the price of rebar in 1979 well the

price of rebar collapsed by 20% it just

turns out that there's a subtle fact

about strategy that nobody had thought

about before and that is a low-cost

strategy only works when you have a high

cost competitor in your market and as

soon as they had fled upmarket now you

were just competing against commodity

players with with comparable prices and

very quickly competition drove prices

down to the poor

we're the mini Mills couldn't make money

in rebar so what are those poor suckers

gonna do well they try to get more

efficient making rebar but that's just a

recipe for survival and then one of them

looked up market and said ladies and

gentlemen look at this if we just make

bigger and better steel we'll make money

again

and so they stretched their ability into

the angle iron barn rod markets and as

they attacked that market on the left

the integrated mills were just happy to

get out of that business because it

truly was a dog-eat-dog business and why

would anybody to defend a crummy 12%

business when up in structural I beams

and H beams you could make 18% margins

so an interesting thing happened as they

lopped off the lowest profit part of

their product line and added up the

remaining numbers their profitability

improved by getting out and the mini

Mills because there they had a 20% cost

advantage again their profitability

improved by getting in so they actually

are quite happy with each other again

until 1984 that was the year when the

mini Mills finally succeeded in driving

the last high cost integrated player out

of angle iron bar and rod you look at

what happened to the prices of those

products in 1984 Paul collapsed by 20%

and the reward to the mini Mills for

their victory is they couldn't make any

money so one of those suckers gonna do

they gotta move up market and as they

attacked the slot the smallest of the

i-beams or h-beams

the integrated Mills was man they were

happy to get out of that business

because it was such a dog-eat-dog

have I told you a story before but the

same thing happens they got out their

profitability improve they integrate

many Mills as they got in their

profitability improved they were happy

with the result both sides until 1996

and that was the year when the mini

Mills finally succeeded in driving the

last hike integrated steel company

Bethlehem out of the structural steel

market in 96 the beam business collapsed

by 20% and so what's new core the

biggest of the mini Mills gonna do they

got to figure out how to make sheet in a

mini mill context and as they attacked

the sheet steel market at the beginning

it was just commodity sheet and the

reaction of the integrated Mills was

they were just happy to get out of the

commodity sheet because the margins and

specialty Steel's are so much higher so

here we are today in America the mini

Mills account for between 60 and 65

percent of the entire steel market all

but one of the integrated steel

companies has gone bankrupt you notice I

was able to tell this whole story

without using the words stupid manager

once because there's no stupidity

involved every time the integrated steel

companies got out their profitability

improved and every time the mini Mills

got into the business that those guys

got out of their profitability improved

and if they had not kept moving upmarket

they would have not have a competitive

advantage and so it really is the

pursuit of profit that caused these

companies to do what they did and a good

way to visualize how this works is just

imagine

that you're a little boy and you want to

kill a giant how would you do it well if

you think that you can kill the giant on

the integrated steel trajectory by

introducing a better product that you

could sell for better profits to the

Giants best customers the giant will

just kill you but if instead you come

underneath them and define a fight where

the giant is actually motivated to flee

rather than fight you that's the way a

little giant kills kills it that's how

little boy kills a giant and we call

this process the process of disruption

you know when when this kind of thing

happens somebody comes in with just they

can only do the simplest of the things

we're inclined in a static way meaning

at this point in time they can't compete

against us but what you've described is

there's a dynamic dimension to that that

is those guys you can never predict

where the technology will come from that

allows them to go up market but what you

can predict with perfect certainty is

they're motivated to trying that's a

great example I don't know if any of you

know this company called Toyota do you

remember how Toyota came to America they

didn't come in with Lexus's they came in

in the nineteen sixties of the rusty

little subcompact called a Corona and

then they went from a Corona to Tercel

Corolla Camry Avalon 4runner Sequoia and

then des Lexus and General Motors and

Ford were making big cars for big people

on the inner indicate in integrated

steel company trajectory and General

Motors and Ford would look down and see

Toyota come

after him and they say you know those

guys let's just go get those buggers and

they design and deploy as Chevette or a

Pinto but then they would compare the

profitability of the little subcompact

with the profitability of making even

bigger SUVs and bigger even bigger

pickup trucks for even bigger people and

it's made no sense and then step by step

Toyota just nailed Detroit to the wall

who's killing Detroit or who's killing

Toyota Toyota doesn't feel like they're

being disrupted for Hyundai and Kia the

Koreans and they've really stolen much

of the low end of the market from Toyota

but it's not because Toyota is asleep

but just is why would they ever want to

defend the least profitable part of

their business when they have the

privilege of competing against Mercedes

and then cherry comes from China next

and thank goodness we don't have to

worry about those guys

now I want to I guess so that's just one

thing I hope you'll remember from clays

visit with you today is if I should

worry what kills me are the folks at the

bottom of the market and they pick off

the least profitable customers from me

and interestingly the customers never

when they decide to to do business with

the provider at the low end your

customers is they defect they rarely

call you up and say you should just

understand why I'm leaving they just

disappear there's no signal from them

and all of the signal you get are the

customers on top of you who demand even

more and so it's the the the the signal

is herbal in the as you try to pursue

profit now the second idea I wanted to

offer is a concept that only academic

could invent and that is competing

against non consumption and what I mean

by that is if there's a need in the

market there are actually a lot of

people who don't take advantage of that

offering because they don't have the

money and when somebody makes it

affordable and accessible then you

compete against non consumption and in

almost every case non-consumption opera

operas offers the greatest opportunity

to grow but you don't see it and your

your the way you keep the books don't

cause you to look for non consumption so

what I'm gonna do here this is very

week but can you see I've got three

concentric circles there and they

represent tears in the market where the

people in the innermost circle are

customers who have a lot of money and

then as you go to the larger circles

they represent customers who have less

money and less skill until you come to

the largest one the periphery of the

market where at least clay has lived

most of his life and what I'm imposing

in the circle in the middle is this

model of disruption the technology goes

up faster than the customers can use it

and I'd like to describe how way back in

our history a set of companies that made

product consumer electronics products

out of vacuum tubes got killed and they

were killed by the transistor so those

of you with the gray a bit of gray hair

will remember that up through the early

1970s almost all consumer electronics

products were made with vacuum tubes and

a vacuum tube was the size of a fire

that's my child's fist and the

televisions were a little bit bigger

than this and inside there would have

been about 20 or 25 vacuum tubes these

things sucked up a lot of power and they

emitted a lot of heat in today's dollars

a TV cost over three thousand US dollars

and that meant in order to have it you

had to have a big bank account in a big

home for this to fit on the floor

somewhere the transistor emerged from

Bell Labs in the late 40s it was

disruptive because it couldn't handle

the power required to be used in the

products that existed TVs and radios

all of the companies that made the

vacuum tube products saw that the

transistor was important and so they

took a license from Bell Labs and they

carried their license into their own

laboratories and framed the problem as a

technological problem in other words the

transistor can't handle the power that's

required for it to be used in the market

and as a group these vacuum tube

companies in today's dollars spent

nearly three billion dollars trying to

make the transistor good enough that it

could be used in the market while they

were working on that other innovators

decided that they would try to make

products that are so much more

affordable and accessible that whole new

populations of people would have access

to that and so the first application was

a hearing aid in 1951 and you actually

couldn't make a hearing aid with vacuum

tubes then in 1955 Sony introduced the

first portable and transistor radio that

fit right in your pocket it costs two

dollars and it was truly a crummy

product my brother and I had bought one

and we in order to get reception we were

raised in Salt Lake City

we had the stands and face west to the

Great Salt Lake it was a tinny sound

static filled but my brother and I loved

that little radio because it was

infinitely better than nothing which was

our other option and allowed us to do

something that previously was

unthinkable and that is we could listen

to rock and roll out of the earshot of

our parent are our children are our

parents who thought it was evil

and then in 1959 Sony introduced the

world's first portable television again

it was a very limited product but it

sold for $99 instead of several million

dollars and a whole new population of

people now had access to a television

and again they were it was infinitely

better than nothing and so they were

thrilled to have this limited product so

a booming new market emerged competing

against non consumption even while the

core people that are there vacuum tube

company continued to invest in the

technology so that their customers could

use vacuum tubes instead of I'm sorry

they would use the transistor instead of

the vacuum tube and they felt they felt

no pain because these are all new

customers that Sony and Panasonic were

pulling into the market but then then by

the mid-1960s solid-state technology was

good enough that you could start to

build big products out of it and within

the next eight years or so the late

sixties early seventies you just heard

this big big sucking sound as the

customers were sucked out of the vacuum

tube companies into this new arena of

competition and every one of the vacuum

tube companies vaporized

like RCA Zenith General Electric who

were big players in that market and it's

not that they were stupid

they said the vacuum tube companies saw

the technology long before Sony saw it

they spent 30 times more more capital in

the technology than Sony ever spent on

it on the technology but what they

framed is that the market

that they're serving our is comprised of

customers who buy and they didn't think

about is there non consumption of the

products that they're offering but they

just can't have access to it because

nobody has figured out how to make it

affordable to them and so I don't know

your business well enough to know might

there be non consumption but I can

imagine there would be and so let me

just give a couple of ideas in in other

industries and then just have you think

about it so there's a technology called

CT scanning and the neat thing about CT

scanning is that radiologists can look

inside your body and and and catch

things by by happenstance they see a

growth coming in that you national

symptom that it's there you know and

you're really lucky if they catch it but

these CT scans cost several hundred

thousand dollars to operate to buy and

you gotta be a radiologist or a skilled

technician to operate and evaluate this

stuff wouldn't it be interesting if the

cost of a CT scan a simple one cost

twenty-five thousand dollars instead of

two hundred and fifty thousand dollars

and it was so simple to operate that

every personal care physician had one of

these things in their office and when

you come there to get your annual

checkup the doctor historically to

figure out what's going on inside

to feel and listen you know that much of

what they miss they miss because they

can't walk inside they can't look inside

your body and if you could just see the

doctor because they just laid laid down

on this bed and we're gonna go and to

see if there's anything going on that we

should worry about there's enormous

amounts of non consumption of this

technology it's very safe but nobody has

figured out that they want to compete

against non consumption but that's just

a way to think about it in in your

business this is happening at the

Harvard Business School as we as we

speak you know is a very expensive place

to get educated about management and we

only allow 900 people in and there is an

enormous about amount of non consumption

of learning about management and what's

happening to us is online learning and

corporate universities are booming just

booming competing against non

consumption and Harvard Stitz back in

the blue space feelings good about

ourselves and a booming new market is

emerging right next to us and we look

out at that down our noses and say it's

not as good as Harvard and that's the

right answer to the wrong question the

question is is it getting better and

better and we're being disrupted by

right now crummy low-end on-the-job

learning that you're experiencing from

me right now

we work in a highly regulated yeah 50

different states have 50 different sets

of rules you know and many of the

products that we sell yeah and you know

that seems to tamp down some of the

innovation etc so it I hate to tell you

this everybody thinks their business is

different and everybody thinks the

regulation makes it very difficult

you've got to innovate inside the box as

a general rule we innovate in the face

of regulation by innovating outside the

reach of the regulator so for example

you guys there enough gray hair here to

remember regulation queue in the banking

industry this was a wonderful regulation

adopted in the Great Depression and it

made it illegal for a bank to pay

interest on checking accounts isn't that

a wonderful regulation for the banks oh

I would love to pay you interest but

they won't let me do it you know and so

all kinds of people wanted to change the

regulation but it was so much in the

interest of the bank's not to change

that it just couldn't change and then in

the late 70s Merrill Lynch came up with

this idea called them mint money market

fund and you could write a check on that

and you could pay interest and Merrill

Lynch was outside the reach of the bank

regulators and then fidelity did the

same thing and the customers then just

evacuated the banks and then the

regulation had change in an ex post

realization

that the world has changed and almost

always when regulation is a barrier some

figured out how to innovate outside the

reach so thank goodness you're in your

business and I'm in mine because I just

have to say things and you've got to do

it I'll come back to this in a second

so I want to I want to get out of your

industry for a second and just talk

about something that's going on in our

economy which I think has some salience

to how you do your work in the puzzle

here is that the US economy has had nine

recessions since World War two in six of

the nine the first six of the nine

recessions employment had rebounded to

the prior peak before the the downturn

it took about six months for employment

to turn around but we had a recession in

1991-92 where it took our economy

fifteen months to get employment going

up then we had a recession in 2001 and -

it took our economy 39 months to turn

unemployment around and now we've been

trying to turn around an employment for

about 67 months now and we are nowhere

near getting out of the rest

and there's just something fundamental

has gone wrong in the national economy

and we're experiencing what people will

call a jobless recovery and we've been

working on this and this is this is what

we're figuring out there are three types

of innovations one type of innovation

we're calling market creating

innovations on the left and these are

the things that we're talking about

innovations that make it affordable and

accessible so that larger populations of

people have access computers went

through that the personal computer

enabled many more people to have a

computer and use it Model T was market

creating innovation by making a car

affordable and accessible sustaining

innovations are the second type and

sustaining innovations are the kind of

things that the integrated steel

companies were following they make good

products better market creating

innovations create jobs because by

making it affordable and accessible more

people buy it and therefore you have to

hire more people to make it and sell it

and distribute distribute it and service

it and so on but sustaining innovations

which make good products better they

don't create jobs because by their very

nature if they convinced me to buy their

new product I don't buy the old product

if Toyota convinces me to buy a Prius I

don't buy a Camry and so sustaining

innovations are very important in an

industry but they are replace it've in

character and then the third type of

innovation we call efficiency innovate

Asians in efficiency innovations allow

you to do more for less and sell the

same products to the same customers

cheaper so Geico is a efficiency

innovation they can do it you know over

the net for 15% or so lower cost because

of that business model and efficiency

innovations eliminate jobs but

efficiency innovations typically create

capital because you're trying to do more

with less so they're always trying to

get assets off the balance sheet to be

able to sustain the business with less

and less with less capital so what's

happened in America is we have in our

midst a new church that emerged in the

last 40 years or so and we call a church

of new finance and we call finance a

church because just like a real church

they have doctrines in this church and

they have high priests in the church

these happen to be business professors

like me and partners in in funds and so

on and we have Commandments and I want

to just talk about talk a bit about the

impact that these how we will measure

success has had on our economy so before

the 1970s the way we measured success

was in whole numbers like or crude

measures like tons of cash but then the

high priests decided that there are to

be more sophisticated ways

to measure success because we wonder

really we want a husband the use of

capital and deploy capital only in

situations where it can be leveraged the

best and we have to be very efficient in

the way we use capital and so rather

than measure success in numbers they

offered measurements in ratios and the

ratio as you know is the fraction

there's a numerator and a denominator

and the great thing about a ratio is

that it gives managers to twice as many

options for how to report success so for

example return on net assets return on

there are several cousins to that if I

want to get Rona up I got two options

one is yeah I could be more innovative

and generate more profit and put that in

the numerator of the ratio but what the

heck if innovation is just too hard I

just have to reduce the denominator of

the fraction by outsourcing stuff and

get assets off the balance sheet either

one

Rhona goes up and I'm doing a good job

or a number three internal rate of

return is a fraction and if I want

internal rate of return to go up sure I

mean I could be more innovative and put

profit in the numerator but what the

heck if innovation is hard I just have

to the denominator is a measure of how

quickly you get your money out after you

put it in and so why don't we just not

invest in anything that pays off in the

longer term and if we only focus

investments in short term returns then

internal rate of return goes up so it's

really kind of neat a neat system isn't

it

I've got twice as many levers that I can

pull to get the measures up
