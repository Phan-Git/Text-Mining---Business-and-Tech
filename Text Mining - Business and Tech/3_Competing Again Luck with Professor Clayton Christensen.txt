good afternoon it's pretty good

good afternoon all right all right there

we go

I have good news and bad news I'll start

with the bad news the bad news is if you

just arrived at the summit you have

missed incredible speakers conversations

about what's happening across our nation

today if you didn't just arrive the bad

news is you've had lunch probably a

snack it's 3:00 in the afternoon and

you're feeling it the really good news

is I get to introduce our next speaker

and I can say personally professionally

dr. Christensen is one of the best

world-renowned thinkers today I suppose

his groundbreaking book the innovators

dilemma is the standard starting point

he wrote about the lumbering Goliath of

the business world successful set in

their ways and seemingly invincible but

despite their size and armor they became

easy prey for the David's and their

Shepherds slings how quickly fortunes

changed when confronted with the

disruptive force of new approaches and

new technology professor Christensen

pointed out that the time to adapt as

before the stone is even in the air at

that point it is too late in the modern

economy disruption is the new normal and

to the anticipation and innovation is

how you survive when professor

Christensen laid all this out in 1997

Amazon was an embryo and the founders of

Netflix were sending out a test DVD to

see if that would survive the post

office obviously he was a man ahead of

his time those who listened include

Steve Jobs Michael Bloomberg and Bill

Gates Paul Steinberg the chief

technology officer of Motorola Solutions

said this about professor Christensen he

scared the crap out of me

The Economist named the innovators

dilemma one of the six most important

books ever written about business

professor Kristensen followed that up

with several other groundbreaking

bestsellers becoming the nation's

foremost authority of disruptive

innovation in disrupting class how

disruptive innovation will change the

way the world learns he makes the

compelling case for using technology to

create a customized student-centered

education system Forbes called professor

Christensen one of the most influential

business theorists of the late 50 years

last excuse me last 50 years twice he

was ranked number one in the thinker's

50 considered the world's most

prestigious ranking of management

thinkers I could go on and on as you can

tell but let me conclude with words from

his daughter Ann who in an interview

with Forbes gives us insight into the

passion he has for teaching and the joy

he takes in knowledge she said my dad is

a perpetual student he'd come home from

work every day excited about some common

a student had made or a paper they'd

written he'd say you'll never believe

what I learned today ladies and

gentlemen please help me welcome

professor clay Christensen

[Music]

gosh is just overwhelming to see people

with so much substance amongst you to

spend your time listening to me but I

really hope that a few of the ideas that

I offer might be helpful in the world

that that you're taking on what I want

to do is talk to you about what I've

learned over the last 40 years of a

student about how to make organizations

change I decided that it didn't make any

sense for me to tell you what I think

you ought to know about changing our

schools but I did think that when you

find a program or evidence that you want

to change how do you make it happen and

I am afraid that in order to do this

you're going to sit in the audience and

wonder why he went that way instead of

this way and then why did he but I hope

that it'll in the end fall into place so

a number of years ago I was just at work

minding my own business and I got a call

from secret Secretary of Defense William

Cohen who was the Secretary of Defense

when Clinton was our president and I'd

never met him before

but out of the blue he said clay I

wonder if you had come to the Pentagon

because we want to study what you've

written in the first of my books the

innovators dilemma to see what it means

for us and jeez for me

to have an opportunity to go to the

Pentagon was a life-changing event so I

said of course I'll come and he said we

figured out a date and he said that he

wants to present my research to his

entire staff and when he said his staff

what I had in mind was I had been hidden

in his office before as a White House

Fellow and I imagined that he'd have his

staff of seven seven or eight

lieutenants and and majors that he met

me at the front door and ushered me into

his conference room and there were about

50 people there and he took me to the to

the front and introduced me to the

chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

and then to the other chiefs and then

behind them were the secretaries of the

Army Navy Air Force come down to the

marine corps behind them all of the

under and deputy secretaries and behind

them all of the assistance of everything

else and he I started to get scared and

I I said what do you want me to say and

he said I'll just seriously he said just

present your stuff and I had no idea

what would into in in I had a stroke a

number of years ago and a clot came from

here and lodged itself above my mind

above my head and it killed the place

where I formulated speech and so under

you'll notice as I give my talk I can't

come up with the right words sometimes I

apologize for them but he is secretary

Cohen just said present your material

and then he sat down and I described

people there this theory of mine called

disruption and I'll I'll describe it in

terms of steel an industry of us making

steel as if I come back here is an

illustration of disruption and what I

described was in the steel industry at

the bottom of the market our simple

products that we call concrete

reinforcing bar or rebar you and I can

make rebar this afternoon in this if we

wanted to and then as you move up market

there are more sophisticated higher

performing products like iron and

rod-and-reel

above those are those structural steel

products like H beams and eye beams and

the final is sheet steel that we used to

make appliances and cars and then I

described in that industry how the

ability to make steel improved over time

and there were innovative companies that

were making good products better as they

went higher and higher in the market and

I said that this is this describes the

organization of almost every company the

products begin at the middle and then

they go up as you'll see why in a minute

and in the history of steel there was

something that made it even a little bit

complicated and that was in the 1960s a

new way of making steel emerged and it

came down at the bottom of the market

going after rebar and the reason why

they came down at the bottom is they had

figured out a different way to make

steel that reduces the cost of steel by

about twenty percent and the way they

did it was they found scrap put it in a

big container and hit it with

electricity and a big explosion occurs

and all of this scrap steel becomes

liquid from which they then can make

products the reason why the mini and the

mini Mills came in at the bottom of the

market however is that the quality that

they could produce was really crummy and

nobody would buy what the mini-meals

made except the rebar people at the

bottom of the market because there are

almost no specs for rebar to begin with

and then once you buried it in cement

you couldn't verify whether they had

Nets better or not and so rebar was a

perfect product for crummy products and

as they attacked the bottom of the

market interesting the reaction of the

big integrated steel companies was to

get out of that business and the reason

why is it wasn't good enough for what

their customers needed and the economics

were crummy so their gross margins the

mini-meals at the bottom of the market

offered just 7% and the integrated steel

companies looked at should we protect

the bottom of the market or maybe we

ought to move up to make higher profit

products making angle iron and

structural steel and so on

so as the mini-meals expanded their

ability to make rebar the integrated

mills got out of the business or they

focused on higher margin products

because the margins in structural iron

and rod and and bar offered 12 percent

margins so they moved aggressively up

there and as the integrated mills looked

down at the mini mills coming up

they thought you know we could make 12%

in those products but if we could just

make even better steel in structural

steel up there the gross margins are 80

our 18% and so as they got out of the I

am not I angle iron and barn rod markets

for the integrated steel companies their

profits improved by getting out and as

the mini mills came in their profits

improved by getting in and it really fit

with each other but what happened Ted to

the prices of rebar and angle iron and

steel as they got out and moved up

market and the integrated mills reacted

by giving out both of their profits

improved over time integrated mills by

getting out and the mini mills by

getting in and as soon as they had

driven the last high cost integrated

player out the prices of steel dropped

by 20% and so the the the cost of rebar

dropped by 20% in 1979 when the

integrated mills got out and then this

Deere the cost of a angle iron and barn

rod again dropped by 20% when the

integrated Mills got out and as the as

they dropped at the prices dropped out

the integrated Mills moved up and the

integrated Mills moved in

and so in 1979 they integrated in into

structural steel the price dropped by

20% and the integrated Mills then moved

up into structural steel and the

integrated steel companies had to go up

as soon as they could in order to make

money and so that's the story I I

haven't

then a justice here though one of the

things that we I would just say there

are in this story there's no bad

management involved the integrated steel

companies now have declined to account

for only twenty thirty percent of the

total amount of steel made in America

and the integrated are the new new

course of the world now produce about

seventy to eighty percent of all of the

steel and nobody intended to have this

happen it just happened in the pursuit

of profit and so I described how this

had worked in the industry at the steel

industry in secretary a general Shelton

who was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs

Kyle had put his hand up and he said

clay you're clueless about why we're

interested in your study and I said I am

clueless can you help me

and he he said leave this chart on the

board and and he he then had a marker

and he went up to the top of the market

where we saved a steel sheet steel and

he said we don't call that sheet steel

we call that the Russians and they have

been the high end of our market they

have been very complicated / capable

opponents and he said what you call the

integrated steel mills we call that the

US Department of Defense and we tried to

do everything for everybody and then at

the bottom of the market he crossed out

rebar and he said for us that's those

are the Russians those are the 10 the

terrorism the terrorists and they're

just doing the simplest of the things

but they're going up and what you call

mini mills we call that non nation

nations like al-qaeda and there isn't

anything he said about the way we make

the way these guys makes steel and the

way were organized give us any hope at

all that we can succeed in fighting

terrorism and and and the non nation

nations anyway when we finished the

study the discussion and it was time for

questions a lot of questions went up in

the air and many of the questions were

focused on do you have any examples of

somebody an integrated steel company

that was the core leader in the industry

who got caught by coming at the bottom

of the market by the mini mills is there

any example of some that survived

and it turned out that there were a few

but in every case they had they had been

successful by setting up a completely

different business organization and

giving them a charter at the bottom of

the market to do simple products and

then move up and I described there have

been a few examples of people who have

done that like IBM did it but there are

only a few and and everybody who

survived had to do this and then they

had all kinds of questions about why

this was and so on anyway for after

about two hours we there was no time but

we agreed that we would stay in touch

about two months later secretary Cohen

called me up again and he said you need

to know that today we're announcing a

fourth unit in the Department of Defense

we have the Army Navy Air Force and the

new one we call special forces command

to go up to go after terrorism and I

complimented him on what I thought was a

very insightful decision and he said you

know we have been probably have been

wrestling with this problem for how to

organize to go after terrorism we've

been working on this for six years and

we have never been able to make progress

because we sit around and we talk past

each other and we don't agree on

anything and he said what this taught us

is that there is no data about the

future and we have been arguing about no

data and then he said

what you brought was a common language

and a common way to frame the problem

and by providing the language and the

way to frame the problem and an

understanding with this being a theory

of what happened we were able to make

substantial progress in a very short

amount of time because of what you

brought and I just thought that was

brilliant

on his part the insights that there is

no data about the future and so why do

we ever think that we'll be able to

reach consensus when there's no data

that we need and if we can only make

sense on data and until it's available

we will ever never make a we will never

be able to take action and the idea that

you resolve problems by having a common

language also has been very helpful so

that whenever somebody wants me to

explain whether I think it's gonna be

this way or that my policy has been to

say you know I actually don't know the

answer to your question but there's a

theory that has an opinion about your

question and if you wouldn't mind let me

tell you what the theory says that look

at what is what is the opinion that the

theory has and that then might help us

make a better decision faster and I'm

grateful for that opportunity I had that

day in the Pentagon and I think as I as

you pray that our schools will improve

and give us guidance about how to do

that I wanted just to offer that a

common language and a good theory is

actually a more powerful tool for change

than almost anything else that I found

and so that's one of the things that I

would like to offer to you the next

theory that I'd like to offer is an

assertion that we made a bit ago that

the Harvard Business School and its

compatriots have messed up the way

people think in in this this way in

business every time you launch a new

product in order to get the the momentum

behind a new product you've got to be

very careful in putting the case

together you study the market you talked

to people you look at how does how does

it distribute it and made competitive

and made who are the competitors can we

built them and so on you do your very

best you then get the money that you

need to launch it

thinking that it will be successful

turns out that only 20% of the all

products launched in the world only 20%

are successful the other 80% fail and

the question was under if innovation is

just a crapshoot you do your best but

the best isn't good enough

and you just have to try a bunch of

things and a few will win and

to lose and you got to figure out how to

live with that and that's much of what

is taught at the business schools but

then more recently the the mantra has

been you need to just understand the

customer better because if you

understand the customer then you can

decide what they need and develop a

product and you'll be successful it

turns out that that doesn't help either

and let me describe what we've decided

instead about how to develop products

that customers will buy almost all

innovations focus on a job that people

need to get done so as an example here I

am on the stage clay Christensen

unfortunately I just turned 65

unfortunately I spared my whole life at

6 feet 8 inches tall and so I've knocked

my head off how many number of times

when I go through doors I married a

wonderful wife Christine fortunately and

we have five kids thank goodness the

fifth of our five kids Michael

unfortunately went to Stanford and there

are other characteristics and attributes

about me

but my characteristics and attributes

have not yet caused me to buy the New

York Times today there might be a

correlation between the propensity I

have to buy the times but they don't

cause me to do that nor do our

characteristics or attributes cause us

to buy any products or services but what

causes us to do things is

our whole wives are just filled with

problems jobs that arise in our lives

needing to get done and when we find

that we have a job that needs to get

done we then get out of the house and go

around and try to find something that

will get the job done as well as

possible and what causes us to buy

products or services is we have jobs to

do and therefore we realized that

understanding the job is what's critical

in being successful in innovation not

the customer the customers the wrong

unit of analysis so we came upon a prod

project that had been initiated by

McDonald's and McDonald's wanted to

increase the sales of their milkshakes

and as you know McDonald's is a very

sophisticated company and they had

thanked to a lot of data build a profile

of the quintessential milkshake customer

it turns out I fit the profile too

perfectly and they would invite people

like me into conference rooms and ask us

can you help us to know how to improve

our milkshakes so that you will buy more

of them and McDonald's had all the data

in the world and they said yes we can

tell you

and so we would give them the feedback

and it had no impact on sales or profits

whatsoever so we offered to them that

you know we're just coming up with a new

way of thinking that might help you

and I said yeah what it essentially says

is somewhere near here there's a job

that people find themselves needing to

get done on

occasion and it's clear that there's a

job out there that causes people on

occasion to hire a milkshake to do that

job we need to understand what the job

is and so we stood outside of a

restaurant I'm sorry we start we went

into a milk ship into I'm sorry we stood

in a McDonald's restaurant one evening

for 18 hours

and we took very careful notes on what

time did they buy the milkshake what

were they wearing were they alone what

did they make other products with it did

they eat it in the restaurant or did

they get in the car and drove off with

it and it turned out that about 80% of

the products were sold before 8:30 in

the morning it was the only thing they

bought they were always alone and they

always got in the car and drove off with

it so we came back the next year and

positioned ourselves outside the

restaurant so that we could confront

these people as they were coming in with

their milkshake and in language that

they could understand but ask him I got

problems here

what job were you trying to do that

caused you to come here and hire this

milkshake at 8:30 in the morning and as

they would struggle to answer we respond

by saying well can you think about the

last time you're in the same situation

needing to get the same job done but you

didn't come here to hire a milkshake

what did you hire to get the job done

and it turned out that they all had the

same job to do that is they had a long

and boring drive to work and one hand

had to be on the wheel but they had

another hand and there wasn't anything

in it

and they just needed something to do

while they were driving in order to get

this job done they want to be engaged

rather than fall asleep on this boring

commute and that was the job

they weren't hungry yet but they knew

they'd be hungry by 10 o'clock so they

also needed something that would just go

funk and stay there for the morning so

then we asked them well when you don't

come here to hire a milkshake to do the

job

what do you hire one guy said you know I

never thought about it this way but last

Friday I hired adult a banana to do the

job take my word for it never hire

bananas you can eat it in less than a

minute

the taste is there's no taste one guy

said yeah I do I do doughnuts but I have

to do it without my wife knowing because

she wants me to lose weight not gain and

it gets on my fingers and that makes the

the wheel get gooey so it doesn't do the

job very well and other guys say D I do

bagels but they're so dry and tasteless

then I have to steer the car with my

knees while they put on the cream cheese

and then if the phone rings I got three

problems and two hands one guy said I

hired a Snickers bar to do the job done

bit I felt so guilty I've never hired a

nurse and Snickers again but let me tell

you when I come here to McDonald's and

hire this milkshake it is so viscous it

takes me 23 minutes to suck it up that

thin little straw

who cares what the ingredients are all I

know is I'm still full at 10 o'clock and

it turned out that the milkshake does

the job better than any of the

competitors and the competitors are not

Burger King milkshakes as much as as you

compete against bended bananas and

bagels and Snickers bars and coffee and

so on and then it turns out that the

people who hired the milkshakes in the

afternoon hired it for a very different

purpose and that is they just wanted to

talk to people that they loved and they

needed us something who we could just

sit down and I could look at her and she

could look at me and we could just help

them know how much we care for them and

that's a very different job to be done

and it had to be felt formulated in very

different ways it turns out that Peter

Drucker was smarter than me because he

said it early at first that the customer

rarely buys what the company thinks that

it's selling them and understanding what

the job was was very helpful because

they realized that they had been

improving the milkshake on dimensions of

performance that were irrelevant to the

job to be done but once they understood

what the what it was then they could

understand how they could improve it in

salient dimensions so that it would be

successful every time turns out that the

milkshake market is about seven times

bigger than they thought it was and the

reason why is they had been improving

the product on dimensions of performance

that were irrelevant to the job but once

they realized that they are really

competing against bananas

it's and bagels and Snickers bars and

coffee and so on gosh they were those

were duck soup because they were none of

them did the job well at all

it turns out that jobs exist everywhere

so there's a job somewhere near here

which is I need to get this from here to

there as fast as profitable as fast as

possible with perfect certainty that's

the job that arises in our lives on

occasion some more than others it turns

out that Julius Caesar had this job to

do on occasion and when he had the job

to do he could hire a horseman and a

chariot to get the job done

Queen Victoria had the same job to do

but by that time he could she could hire

a telegraph or a railroad to get it done

[Music]

Churchill found on occasion that he had

the same job to do and so he could hire

an airport airplane to do the job and

she could hire DHL or the Internet

it turned us you notice that the

products sold in each generation were

very different than the prior but the

job to be done was very stable over time

and that's a common characteristics of

jobs is that on average they are very

stable over time and therefore we don't

have to try this this year and try that

for next year as long as we were trying

to get the job done there are a lot of

people who have jobs in education that

need to get done students have jobs

teachers have JA

parents do legislators do and many more

and understanding who has what jobs to

do is actually quite important because

we like McDonald's in many times are

improving our offerings on dimensions of

performance that are irrelevant to the

jobs that people are trying to do

especially students we give them all of

the characteristics and attributes we

can think of and we back it up with new

data but we don't understand the the

fundamental jobs that they are trying to

get done so I'd like to walk you through

what we think might be called a

architecture of a brand a architecture

of the job to be done

in every case jobs arise at the bottom

of the fundamental of architecture the

job has to be done given the situation

that I'm in each job has a functional

and emotional and a social dimension to

the job and the weight of those mith

varies by the job once we understand

that then we have the opportunity to

create the next level which is so if

that's the job what are the experiences

that we need to provide in purchase and

use so that in some they will nail the

job perfectly and if we understand those

experiences we need to provide that

allows us to make the next step which is

what do we need to integrate and how do

we need to integrate it so that we can

provide the experience is required to

nail the job

perfectly and if we do that we can put a

brand on our product that will help

people find our product as soon as they

realize that they had a job to do so

what I would like now to do is just go

back in in this architecture and talk up

a little bit more about what I mean I'm

what I'm trying to do is in the blue box

there explode it a little bit to talk

about some what we mean by experiences

we have done a lot of work with southern

New Hampshire University online and

Western Governors University online you

may know together they said they have

about 200,000 students doing MBAs or

master's and bachelor degrees as well as

certificates and certifications and so

on and we know them quite well one of

the things that the architecture demands

to them is to be able to say what are

the experiences in purchase and use and

so we distilled from that that in both

cases there are three experiences that

they need to provide and the first one

is I need to learn when I'm I need to

use it when I'm learning it and then I

will use it again and again and again

I can't keep in my head things that I

don't use after I've learned it so

that's an experience I use it use it and

learn it another experience they need to

have is I need to finish this every

student

has a job to do which is I need to be

successful and many of the students the

reason they're here at Western Governors

in southern New Hampshire is on average

their age is 20 says 36 years old they

have children 70% of them do 70% of them

want a better job 70% of them are there

because they can't buy a home and the

reason why they're there is because when

they were in high school they didn't

apply themselves and so they dropped out

and the fundamental problem of that is

they can concluded themselves that I

can't finish this I've tried it before

I've never done it again and so one of

the experiences they needed to provide

as a coach that helps students take them

through tough times is almost always

these students are in tough times and as

I understood they're what they're

they're thinking I said to them it's got

to be costly to have a coach for each

student to take them through these tough

times and the presidents of both of

these universities responded it's dirt

cheap

what's costly is a student drops out and

it's been very helpful for me to see

that how that happen last summer I was

asked to speak at the graduation of

Western Governors at their 20th

anniversary and they had there was a

very wonderful story in every student's

face as they came across the

and so I wanted to just offer that is we

need to put experiences out there for

our students to have available to them

so that they will get the job done

perfectly

I'll just offer this one last one what

we've studied as we've what we learned

as we've studied about innovation is

that there are two FIR forces that work

against each other so every time I hire

a new product I can't use it until I put

put out the old one which is how I did

it before and this idea that the new

doesn't work unless the old changes or

is gone is actually very important I was

at Costco a bit ago and there was

somebody waiting there waiting in the

line to hire a mattress and one of my

colleagues asked him how long did it

take you to buy that mattress and they

won't look back and they realized that

it had taken him three years to buy this

mattress because every time he was ready

to buy they thought well we could just

put on off for another year or I got a

piece of plywood and I put it under the

mattress so that wouldn't be as flimsy

and my brother-in-law who sold us the

last one told us they have a deal on a

new one and there are just all kinds of

things that happened which were the

habits of the present and the anxiety

about using a new thing to do the

solution and these things blocked change

the block change but then on the other

force there is the push of the situation

because these new things really are

exciting and there are people pulling me

into the future because that it seems to

be a track

and I think what I am I my conclusion of

this is that many of the innovations

that we attempt to achieve in higher

education fail not because they're

intrinsically wonderful ideas but we

never have thought about what are the

habits of the present and the anxieties

about the future and all of the things

that we're doing we have to in which we

have to change our behavior this is the

reason why change is so difficult so

often and this is just another piece

that we have been thinking about about

how to manage change

I think a better stop I have just one

other thing that I wanted to say to you

guys that is a number of years ago for

reasons that I can't fully describe I

realized that God doesn't ever hire

milkshake

he doesn't hire accountants in heaven

which is an idea that I never thought

about before but the language that got

me in that direction came from a rare an

insight that I have a finite mind and

because I have a finite mind God I I

have to be able to hire accountants

because we have all of these inputs and

invoices and outputs and so on and there

are so many pieces of data around me and

my company or in my school thank

goodness we have accountants and they

can aggregate all of these things up and

tell me we've got revenue of this going

at this rate and this is this is how

much better it was than last year's and

I compare this to that and because I

have a finite mind I need somebody who

can make sense of the world for me by

aggregating things up and because of my

finite mind I get a sense of hierarchy

in my world if I preside over bigger

companies that have bigger numbers

I feel more successful than if I preside

over smaller numbers and smaller

organizations

but then somehow I realized that with

God the perspective is different because

God has an infinite mind and what that

means is he doesn't need to aggregate

people up into numbers in order to have

a perfect understanding of what's going

on in the world because God has an

infinite mind he doesn't need to a

granade us up as numbers in order to

have a perfect understanding of what

goes on that then allowed me to stay oh

my gosh what that means is when I have

my interview with him he's not going to

say oh my gosh Clayton Christensen the

professor of the important professor at

the Harvard Business School he's not

even going to say that in my interview

rather what God is going to say yes clay

can we just talk for a minute about the

people that I put you in your path what

did you do to help them to become better

people and then if you remember I put

you in this situation let's just talk

about the people that you helped to

become better people and then clay don't

remember don't rip don't forget that we

gave you five children can we talk about

what you did to help those five people

become magnificent children and I

realized that when God will measure my

life

there will be no numbers over which I

presided but rather God is going to ask

me the individual people that I helped

to become better people and I just can't

as I have as I come to the end of my

life I realized that now I know how God

will measure my life and I hope that I

can say that everyday I did all that I

could to help people in my path to

become better people and I just wanted

to close by thanking you guys I think

that you have chosen a truly noble

profession and I know that as god

assesses how you've done it adds up in

his mind not in numbers but as

individual people in his mind that are

important to him and I thank you for the

noble profession that you have chosen

thank you and God bless
