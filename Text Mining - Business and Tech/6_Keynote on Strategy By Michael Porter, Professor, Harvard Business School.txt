so in fact we now move on to the most

important part of the day because of the

reason he's a person because of whom we

are all gathered here today but I would

like one of my good friends again three

Watsa to come and introduce professor

Porter he's been his student he is known

import close to about 20 years a little

over 20 years and that's where it is

silhouette sir can you come up stage in

to a quick introduction woman thank you

amid Michael Porter is perhaps one of

the few boundary spanners in this world

his influence extends across businesses

not-for-profits and governments there

are very few presidents and leaders in

the corporate world who haven't

benefited from his immense thought

leadership I had the great privilege of

learning and studying from him and an

interesting anecdote is to get into his

course first you could get into Harvard

Business School what would you do only

clear the GMAT which is in very tough to

get into his course is another test and

he's the only course in hardwood where

you take another test to enter his

course and people from across all the

schools at it at Harvard University

write that test to get into his course

and it is perhaps the most sought-after

course at Harvard so that is something

very unusual and as the joke goes at

Harvard you have professors who come and

sit in in that course and learn how to

teach the case method learn how to teach

like Michael Porter 23 honorary

doctorates there are twenty-four

university professors at Harvard all of

Harvard and he is one of them one of the

highest perhaps the highest honor the

Harvard University bestows on everyone

he at Princeton was an all-american

golfer and managed a rock band when he

was doing his PhD at Harvard he's the

proud father to two daughters one of

whom works at the World Bank and is

already creating waves there I can only

end by saying two things one for me as a

student he's been a guru strategy is

Porter and Porter is strategy and last

but not the least ladies and gentlemen

yesterday Michael Porter turned 70 so we

should all sing happy birthday and wish

him the very very best in life

Michael all over to you thank you well

my gosh well first of all I want to

thank all of you for coming today and

being part of this event I I have of

course been very very close to this

Porter prize over the last five years

and it's a real thrill for me finally to

be able to actually be part of it

actually

Amit for kind of his entrepreneurial

zeal in making this happen he's he's

awesome amazing effort

I want to thank Surratt so my my

treasured student from HBS who I've has

been my lifeline to India for many years

but I also want to thank all of you for

participating in this and using this

prize in this occasion for learning

first of all to raise the learning in

the organization but also to use it as a

vehicle for your company to hopefully

move move forward and this whole thing

is just amazing to me that it happened

and I'm very proud that it happened here

in India and I'm very honored that so

many of you have been involved over the

years so today since I'm here only let

me have a little time today so I could

talk all day no problem in fact I'd

enjoy that but today we are I'm going to

have a chance to talk to you about

really three different aspects of my

work so starting this morning with the

very core the very original work which

still continues on strategy so we'll

start with strategy and then a little

bit later in the day or mid day we'll

talk about the relationship between

strategy and society and how we're

starting to understand how business can

actually play a

much more powerful role in shaping the

society around us something has been

left to government in NGOs I think we in

business have to engage because without

us without business I think it's very

hard for the other institutions to

actually move an entire society along

like like India and this is the country

I think that's ready for the business

community to play a more fundamental

forceful positive role in really driving

the society and so we'll talk about that

and then a little bit later in the day

related to the society issues one of the

most recent bodies of work that I have

been involved in has has is called the

social Progress Index and it's an effort

to actually bring the same rigor to

measuring and thinking about societal

improvement as we've focused on economic

improvement as many of you know I've

been deeply involved in economic

development for many many years I've

worked with many countries I'm very

honored to have a chance tomorrow in

Delhi to engage with your leaders about

the strategy of this country but I think

what we've learned is that economic

progress also requires social progress

but we haven't had the same measurement

and rigor for thinking about social

progress as we've had in the economic

sphere so about three or four years ago

I started an effort with Michael Greene

who's here a global effort to build

really a benchmarking and measurement

platform for how societies are improving

or not improving and we'll talk about

that later today

hopefully the some of these topics will

kind of give us a very broad picture of

some of the most important questions we

all have to address as businesses

but also will give you a chance to get a

flavor onto some of my newer work I

today I work in many many fields beyond

strategy I work in healthcare so I've

helped in they involved in healthcare

system that reform all occur on the

across the world I'd love to talk about

to that that today but we don't have

time next time I've done a lot of work

on the new digital technologies that

were talked about earlier that are

changing competition the Internet of

Things Marc connected products how how

products and competition are changing as

a result of technology and that's a

topic that we may want to discuss in the

QA I've written three or four papers on

that so my work is broadened since the

last time I was here in India it's been

too long since I've been here and I'm

extremely excited to have a chance to

actually experience this incredible

country again so with that let's start

and talk about the subject that I think

is my core subject and I think the

subject that remains really one of the

the the the areas that ultimately have

the most impact on the success of a

business and that is having a clear

strategy and I think all of us would

agree with that but what I've found and

I continue to work with many companies

around the world you know hands on what

what I still see is despite the fact

that we all know that we need a strategy

despite the fact that we all understand

you know that word and how important it

is I think there's still a lot a lot of

learning necessary in most organizations

so hopefully this session will be an

opportunity to give you kind of my

latest perspective on how to think about

strategy you're going to see a lot of

things that are familiar

because I think some of the fundamental

principles we introduced some years ago

are stronger than ever but we're also

going to kind of hopefully I'm going to

get a chance to talk to you about some

of the learning that comes from all this

work in the field over over so many

years it's kind of shocking to have a

birthday like this but I'm going to I'm

going to forget about that and focus on

all the incredible amount of work that

still needs to be done and not not get

too comfortable with with with the past

so let's talk about strategy I want

everybody in this room to think about

your company and as we're talking this

is not a theory this is about how to

think about your own business and how

you're developing how you're thinking

about it the choices you're making what

choices you're making

and so let's use this as a working

session and then over the course of the

day we're going to hear from a number of

other companies that are doing really

interesting work and hopefully will

accumulate Lee as a result of all of

this I think we'll all enrich our

understanding of this very very

fundamental topic strategy now what do

we what do we kind of learned about how

to think about strategy well I think

what we learned is that the instinct

that most leaders have about success and

and most people actually have about

success is dangerous is potentially

distracting what I find is that when

when you ask a company what success

looks like the answer that you get I get

a lot is well I want to be the best

company in my industry

I want to be the best Bank I want to be

the best auto company I want to be the

best consumer packaged goods company in

this category I want to be the best

that's success if I can be the best

company in my industry I will succeed

and that is a very natural human way to

think we all hope to be the best at what

we do

but in business competition and what

we've come to understand is that's

actually not the way to think about

success the reason is that there is no

best company so it's pretty dangerous to

try to do something that's impossible

there is no best auto there is no best

insurance company it all depends it all

depends there is no better there's no

one way to compete the biggest mistake

in strategy is to think that there's

only one way to compete in every

industry there are different ways to

compete depending on what customer and

customer needs you're actually trying to

meet so when you ask the question what's

the best car or the best car company you

can't answer that because being the best

all depends on who you're trying to

serve if you're trying to serve young

families being the best is different and

if you're trying to serve people like me

serving people that want you know luxury

and performance to be the best at that

is very different than providing a very

very low cost efficient you know

electric vehicle there is no best way to

compete there are lots of good ways to

compete depending on who you're trying

to serve so that number one principle

strategy is don't think this way

[Applause]

instead what you want to think about is

how can I in my company be unique how

can I create unique value for the set of

customers I choose to serve strategy is

fundamentally about choice it's making a

set of choices and the most fundamental

choice is Who am I trying to serve and

one of the worst mistakes in strategy is

to try to serve everybody you can't meet

the need of every customer you just

can't do it it's impossible I've seen

hundreds of companies try it's

impossible you can't need all the needs

of every customer fundamentally if you

have a strategy you've got it aside

which needs of which customers you're

actually going to see to me that you

might be able to do if you're clear

about where you're heading another

tremendous mistake in strategy is to get

into a competition with your competitors

on the same thing if your competitor is

trying to mean the lowest cost it's

pretty unusual to win if you then try to

chase them and be low cost the essence

of strategy is to find a unique position

in your business that delivers unique

value to the customers you choose to

serve sounds simple but most companies

don't do it those companies are confused

they lack clarity on what strap is and

they and in many companies the there is

a fundamental inability to make choices

which ultimately lead to lack of success

now again in a country like India where

growth has been relatively rapid you can

rot you can ride the rising tide and do

okay but I'm talking today about the

companies are going to be truly

successful truly successful not the ones

that are just bumping along with the

market to be truly successful we really

need a strategy and that strategy isn't

about just being the best now you know

the word strategy gets used a lot and I

always tried to help companies I work

with and people I work with kind of have

a clear understanding what we mean by a

strategy here it is strategies a set of

choices we make long term choices to

distinguish ourselves from competitors

that's what it's all about it defines

how we're going to compete differently

and it also really articulates the

competitive advantages that we will seek

to create and use in order to win okay

so at a very high level this is how I

would define strategy again note the

word long term strategy is about long

term it's not about tomorrow and the

next day it's about the long term

because strategy takes a long time to

put in place and implement strategies

about distinguishing yourself being

different if you're doing the same thing

as your competitor you don't have a

strategy you're just trying to do the

same thing better that's what we call

operational excellence we'll talk about

that in a minute

strategy is around choices what choices

you make versus the choices that your

competitors are making strategy then is

different than just we want to be number

102 that's not a strategy wanting to

grow faster is not as you

those are goals those are aspirations

the strategy is the unique position that

allows you to get to whatever goal you

set we can't confuse the strategy and

the goal we can't mix them up we have to

separate the goal we're trying to

achieve and then the strategy is how

we're going to get there

strategy is not just one thing one steps

strategy is not to go international

that's not a strategy you know raising

our knee is not a strategy strategy is

holistic it's the whole set of choices

that you make collectively in order to

position the company for success over

time in the market place it's not just

it's not one step it's a set of steps

strategy involves all the functions it

includes marketing production finance

everything together to create that

unique positioning that's what strategy

is all about and strategy isn't vague

it's not a mission it's very specific as

we'll see

so here's where we start with a sort of

we we all have to get grounded in in a

clear idea what we actually mean by a

strategy and once we start there then we

can start making doing the analysis and

making the choices necessary to get

there

now many of you are public companies and

here we have an additional issue that a

lot of companies get confused about and

that is if you're a public company we

have a stock price and we you know

everybody looks into stock price and

what we what we also have to understand

if we're going to set a good strategy is

actually the stock price is not the goal

the stock price is a result the goal is

superior economic performance strategy

is about creating superior economic

performance in terms of return on

capital and in terms of growth not one

year but on the sustained basis okay and

what we know is that it's economic

performance that really creates value

ice can go up or down depending on what

happens in the world that doesn't mean

that value changed the value is actually

created by the economic performance the

ability to be profitable and earn a good

return on capital and grow that business

well we've got to remember is when we

set strategy we have to focus on the

economic performance part we can't try

to please the stock market we can't try

to figure out what today investors want

that's going to confuse us it's going to

pull us away from where we want to go so

I think you know critical for a strategy

particularly in public companies is the

idea that actually performance

determines shareholder value not the

other way around

you'd be surprised this sounds awfully

simple it's not

I work with hundreds of public company

CEOs and they get all confused about

well who what's what's the scorecard

here

and and the stock market is is sort of a

long-term works pretty well as a

scorecard if you have good economic

performance eventually your stock price

goes up but in the short term stock

price is a lousy way of judging success

the markets can be way off that's what

we find in the studies on this question

so we're this is all about long-term

sustained economic performance and we

have the courage to let the stock price

take care of itself and not try to get

crazy trying to please the analyst or

deal with whatever criticism we're

getting you know in the stock market now

when we think about strategy again

another key principle and then we're

going to dig in a little bit is the

strategy occurs at multiple levels in

any company in many companies not every

company the core level strategy is what

we call business strategy that's how to

compete in each or in the distinct

business in which you operate so here if

you're in passenger cars you'd have a

strategy for passenger cars that's

business strategy but there's in many

companies there's another level of

strategy which is what we call corporate

strategy and that has to do with the

overall strategy of the diversified or

multi business company we got a lot of

conglomerates I don't like the word

conglomerate conglomerate is not a

strategy we've got a lot of companies

though that are more than one business

we got to have a strategy for each one

of the businesses because that's in a

different market competing in a

different way to serve different

customers but we also need to think

about the overall strategy of the

diversified group and that is a very

different animal

and there's a new there's this new set

of principles or a different set of

principle for thinking about that again

I find a lot of confusion a lot of

companies mix these up together

corporate and business get mixed up

that's a mistake we've got to keep these

levels separately and we'll talk about

these briefly as we have time now let's

talk about business unit strategy and

I'll go quite quickly because again I'm

hopeful that most of you are pretty well

grounded in the key ideas here so what

we understand is in it can in a business

a particular business the drivers of

success and the key elements of strategy

have to do with the industry itself the

business itself and the position we

choose to occupy in that business

strategy is both together okay what we

what we understand is that industries

are different in terms of the nature of

competition and we've got to understand

our industry we got to understand how

its competition is evolving where it's

headed what heading and what kind of

competitive dynamics are we gonna have

to contend with we've got to understand

that business by business and then of

course we have to make those choices

about where we're going to compete but

one of the things I I find over and over

again is often the health of your

industry is just as important as how

good a position you have if you're in a

industry that's in trouble that's family

you may have a great position but that's

not very valuable so so we've got to

learn to worry about our industry too we

have to help our industry thrive not

just focus only on our own position

again these are things that we've

learned from many many many examples in

terms of Industry Analysis hopefully

everybody has finds this familiar

you know we after you know 20 or 25

years of work we have overwhelming

evidence that really industry

competition is driven by these

competitive forces that we introduced

many years ago now those competitive

forces collectively drive the

fundamental attractiveness of the

industry the average profitability of

the industry and yeah here's a simple

example in the heavy truck industry and

in our country very difficult industry

if you look at this industry you see a

lot of competitive forces that are

challenging we have a lot of vicious

vicious competition on price among the

truck manufacturers we have some high

regulatory standards which are pushing

up their cost to meet those standards

but it's very hard to pass those costs

on to the customer because the customer

is consolidating into large or larger

fleets and leasing companies that have a

lot of bargaining power in order to push

down the price so the combination of

rising regulatory costs and a powerful

customer is squeezing the truck

manufacturers we see that to make heavy

trucks you make some of the parts

in-house some companies make more some

companies make less but you're also

having to source things like engines and

drivetrain components axles and things

like that and many of the suppliers of

those components that you're buying have

very strong brands and in fact the

trucking company specifies the brand of

the parts that they want on the truck

now they want a Cummins engine for

example

so you're so you're buying for some

suppliers who have a lot of clout

because they have their own relationship

with the end customer so that squeezes

the truck companies the truck

manufacturers in the middle this is in

in North America primarily but the same

basic structure exists in many other

parts of the world it actually isn't

that hard to enter the industry enter

the threat of entry and entry barriers

are a key part of industry analysis and

you know it's actually harder to get the

dealer network than it is to actually

get the parts and assemble the truck and

then of course trucks are always

competing with substitute substitutes

yet all of us hopefully understand what

the substitute is a substitute is a

different way of meeting the need that's

not the same as your product that meets

the same need that your product does so

if you're trucking if you're a truck

manufacturer you know the customer

doesn't need a truck if they're going to

use the railroad or if they're going to

use water transportation so particularly

you know as railroads reverends have

been a real tough competitor for trucks

over the years okay so this is a classic

example of industry analysis it's

something that is timeless always every

single time you think about strategy you

have to have a systematic rigorous

understanding of your industry and what

are the competitive drivers and how are

they changing are they getting worse

than getting better where where's the

new competitive force coming from that

you're going to have to deal with if

you're going to if you're going to win

in that particular industry you know

here's another example of an industry

industrial gases this industry makes

oxygen hydrogen argon all these

industrial gases that are increasingly

used in production processes in all

kinds of other in

history's and what your first look at

this industry says oh my god do I really

this is a pretty tough industry because

I'm selling industrial gases that are

commodities hydrogen is hydrogen how can

I ever make money just selling a

commodity gas particularly when I'm

selling to a lot of customers who often

have bargaining power their big

manufacturing companies industrial gases

are made with feedstocks like you know

petrochemicals and I have no control

over the price of the feedstock so if

the feed stock price goes up I'm in

trouble if I'm selling a commodity gas

again not so good element of the

industry you know it's not not that hard

to get in I mean lots of people

configure it use the figure out how to

make helium or hydrogen and have a

little facility in the in the in the

factory and many of the customers decide

well this is not something I want to buy

I want to make my own industrial gases

in-house and make them right right in my

factory right on the production line

okay so again here's an industry your

first look says not so good I don't want

to play here that's your first instinct

but again what we learn about industry

analysis is we've got to we've got to be

sophisticated we can't just take the

superficial look at the industry we've

got to dig down a little bit and if we

dig down in this industry what we've

learned is actually it's quite an

exciting and interesting industries in

fact the companies in this industry have

done very well and the reason is that we

if the superficial look doesn't really

get at the true industry structure so

just an example is that probably the

most interesting thing about the

industry is that the cost of

transportation are very high to move gas

from your plant

to your customer takes a big truck it's

very expensive to ship

it's got to be shipped under pressure

and you have to kind of have a big

tanker truck and it has to go to the

customer site it has to unload the gas

through you know pumping it into the

tank there and a transport cost means

that in order to be efficient in this

industry you have to have density of

customers so if you have you have only

one customer and then buy and you have

to drive all the way to Mumbai for one

customer and spend all that money to

drive that truck full of helium here and

you get to offload a little bit for one

customer your costs are going to be very

high but if you come to Mumbai and you

have 17 customers and your trucks from

one to the next to the next and they're

all close by then actually that makes

your business super efficient compared

to the guy who's only going to deliver

to one or two customers transportation

costs take a very superficially lousy

industry and make it into a very

attractive industry because all of a

sudden if you have a dense group of

customers in a given market it's almost

impossible for your competitor to attack

you it's just too expensive

they'll never they'll never be able to

afford to win those customers and it

creates a lot of because you've got to

build a customer base over a long period

of time and this is a very critical

product for the manufacturing process so

you don't want to try some new cannot be

sure that they'll show up if they don't

show up with your helium you're in

trouble and you're in your plant okay

so again I won't go through the details

but what I'm trying to get across here

is that we all have to be really

sophisticated at industry analysis in

our businesses we got a look below the

surface we can't we can't just say oh

this is the commodity it's lousy

industry uh-uh it's a commodity it's

quite an attractive industry doing

down understand the real entry barriers

understand the real bargaining power of

the customer and the supplier and and

and the people that could see this have

built tremendous businesses in industry

that nobody else wanted to go into which

out for the stock market thought this

was a crummy industry for a long time

boy were they wrong the investors that

could understand how attractive this

business was boy did they do well again

you know what we find in in competition

is that that actually that concepts

themselves are not that complicated but

actually applying them well is really

hard and that applies both to the

companies but also to the investors that

are trying to figure out whether a

company is successful there will be

successful how do we achieve superior

profitability in the industry whatever

the industry attractiveness looks like

well that has to do with the two

fundamental types of competitive damage

and and this never changes and never

will change there's only two ways to get

an advantage one is to differentiate

yourself do something better customer

will pay you more for it because you're

delivering some something the customer

thinks is better

it could be designed it could be image

it could be functionality it could be

service it could be almost anything but

you know competitive advantage number

one is differentiating and getting a

higher price and if you're

differentiating you better get a higher

price because if you're not getting a

higher price then yep are we really

differentiating if nobody's willing to

pay us extra are we really better and

that's kind of a tough honest question

we have to ask ourself the other kind of

credit advantage is lower cost

if we can actually do something cheaper

and more efficiently and and that's not

just luck that's not just oh we bought a

lower-cost parts this week but if we can

find a way of structurally being

lower-cost because we've redesigned the

way we do things that's the other kind

of competitive advantage and really the

broadest thinking about strategy starts

with okay which path are we on are we

we're on a path to differentiate are we

on a path to be the lowest cost those

are both good pass depending on the

circumstances but we we've got to

usually decide which path we're going to

be on because we're going to really

differentiate and have better quality

and better service and you know better

educated sales force it's going to be

hard to at the same time be lower cost

that's what we've learned so we've got

to figure out what path were on and then

we have to turn it into a strategy using

the value chain and again I hope

everybody here is familiar with that

concept it's quite embedded now in

management thinking the value chain says

you know for any business there's a

whole set of things that we have to do

in order to conduct that business

logistical things operating things which

could be manufacturing marketing sales

service supply chain technology

development you see this and this this

this idea called the value chain is a

way of mapping what what operation in

this industry looks like and this slide

is just an example in the TEL and the

telecom in the mobile communication

business so a sprint or an AT&T in our

country here's the value chain in that

business so you can see if you go back I

this is sort of a general set of titles

but this says okay now in mobile phones

we don't say we have to talk about

device coverage what set of mobile phone

types do we support in our network and

then there's kind of we got to have a

network we got to operate the network

and make that network efficient so you

get you get the bars and you don't lose

your service and you know you can hear

and and so forth and then we got to

figure out how to price pricing is very

complicated in mobile phones all kinds

of special deals prepaid postpaid so

there's there's a lot of choices in

activity there bill processing there's a

lot of marketing promotion PR after

sales support and so forth so every

business has a value chain every one of

your businesses has the value chain and

if you're going to be disciplined and

rigorous about strategy you've got to

you've got to really lay out what that

value changes because strategy is

fundamentally the set of choices you

make across the value chain so what kind

of network am I going to operate

what's my pricing approach how am I

going to distinguish myself from a

competitor you know what what tools am I

going to use for marketing am I going to

have a lot of physical locations and

stores or I'm going to use primarily

advertising what am I going to do to

market my services the other guy and so

forth and so on

strategy isn't sort of any Infotech

thing if it's simply a set of choices

about how we are going to operate the

business including choices about the

technology we're going to sell you know

the function of our product the features

of our product the technology of our

product and a good strategy is one where

there's clarity all the choices were

really making and there's enough things

that we're doing differently that we can

get a competitive advantage so let's

talk a little bit more about about that

the first kind of key idea here in going

from kind of a value chain to strategy

is the notion of operation look

effectiveness versus strategic physician

this is a idea that I didn't have when I

first published my first work books in

this field

I was thinking mostly about strategy but

but I didn't really make make the

distinction that there's a lot that a

company does that isn't strategy there's

a lot of best practice if we're going to

be in the auto industry there's a lot of

things we have to do just to be a good

auto company you know we have to buy the

right kind of machines for our factory

we have to have you know a decent dealer

network we have to you know learn how to

execute good advertising there's a lot

of best practice in every industry and

what we learned is if you're not using

best practice you're going to lose no

matter what your strategy is if you're

not buying the latest manufacturing

equipment your competitors are going to

win you're good at you're going to

you're going to give up too much cost

and quality through that so what we have

to understand is in any company we have

two jobs one is we got to implement all

the best practices that we can find if

we see somebody doing a better approach

to customer you know customer care you

know we better look hard at that and

make sure that we're at least at some

you know threshold level of best

practice that's operational

effectiveness but operational

effectiveness is not strategy

operational effectiveness is doing the

same things as your competitor better

and better and better it's raising the

bar on the same things as all your

competitors are doing your competitors

have a factory they have machines if you

buy the newest machines first then

you'll have an advantage you'll be

operationally better than them until

they buy the machine but that's not

strategy

strategy is on top of operational

goodness you've got to sort of operate

the business well but on top of that you

have to have a strategy and that

strategy is building on the best

practices but then including the choices

that are going to define your uniqueness

in the business both of these things are

important if we're just sloppy and not

enhancing our operation operational

effectiveness we're going to lose no

matter what strategy we have but just

being operationally effective is not

going to get us to superior performance

because all our competitors are going to

be implementing the same best practices

as we do so if we really want to win

we've got to do both and we've got to

make sure that we're clear about what

we're doing and this is a very very

important distinction you know the

question I used to get all the time you

know 15 years ago ten years ago can you

be both low cost and differentiated at

the same time and the answer is usually

you can't but the cases that look like

you're doing that are cases where the

competitor has lousy operational

effectiveness then you can be both low

cost and differentiated but if you've

got a good operationally effective

competitor then to differentiate or to

be lower cost you're going to have to

make real choices okay and you're not

going to be able to do those both at the

same time probably you're gonna have to

decide which path you're on am I on the

path of differentiating my on the path

of being the lowest cost producer to

have a successful strategy we've come to

understand that the process involves you

know these basic conditions

number two have a truly successful

strategy we have to define a unique

value proposition we can't just be

trying to do the same thing as our

competitors are trying to do we have to

be doing something unique and that

involves serving a different set of

customers we're going after the large

industrials our competitors are going

after the medium-sized smaller companies

that's one part of the value proposition

what customers are we actually trying to

serve again so many companies the

customers they have they sort of got by

luck but most important ideas and

strategies you've got to choose your

customers you actually have to choose

who you want your customers to be and if

you choose I want all customers I want

to serve every single customer that's

usually not a good choice because

customers have very different needs

particularly in a complex economy like

like this one you know another another

question you've got to ask of the

customers I choose to serve which of the

needs that they have do I want to

actually meet uniquely well again a lot

of companies just fall into the idea

that anything the customer wants I'm

going to try to provide but actually you

know most great strategies don't do that

or at very least they're very specific

about which customer group and then they

say okay I'm going to go after this

customer group and I'm going to then

really meet all their needs but the idea

that we just try to meet all the needs

that anybody ever comes and asks us to

meet that's usually not a good strategy

and then we're going to have to make

that choice about pricing are we going

for a premium price or we try just to

match the other guy or are we going to

offer discount because we think we're

going to be more efficient and able to

sustain that discount and still

good profits you know this is a company

that's on its way to India I don't think

it's actually opened yet it's been

struggling to get into India like

historically a number of companies have

to have had to do this is one of the

most extraordinary companies in the

world in the area of furnishings EKF

some people call it I care it depends on

are you speaking more Scandinavian are

you speaking more American and this is a

company that that sells home furnishings

and it this is kind of a great strategy

example strategy starts with a unique

value proposition and what you see here

is kind of a sort of simple description

of what their value proposition is who

are the customers that they really are

seeking to serve and what are they

delivering those customers in terms of

products to meet those needs and where

are they pricing okay so I will I won't

read this but just take a quick look at

that okay and you know the interesting

thing about this value proposition is

nobody had ever seen this before this

company nobody had ever segmented

customers in this way nobody had ever

thought about customers with relatively

small living spaces before this was an

innovation in thinking about

segmentation and a lot of great

strategies involve this new way of

looking at customers and segmenting

customers like these guys did also this

strategy was a real breakthrough in you

know kind of operations for a furniture

company and we'll talk about that in a

minute

here's another great strategy example

remember I talked about heavy trucks

earlier and how difficult in industry it

was the average profitability not so

good well here's the company in the

industry that is the premium superior

high profitability company it's called

pack R it's it's it's quite a global

company and you sort of see what their

value proposition was so eye care was

about really low prices this company is

about a premium we're going to get a

premium 10% for our trucks because our

trucks are not going to look like our

competitors trucks our trucks are going

to we're going to have a we have a

strategy that about customization cost

of operation that will allow us to

actually differentiate but not for this

is a wonderful strategy because this

company figured out that the big

customers in the industry weren't the

customers that were the good customers

for them they actually figured out that

the small customers the people that

owned one truck and drove that truck for

their living that was that was the

really interesting customer in this

industry so they built whole strategy

around this narrow group of customers

about 25 to 30 percent of all the

customers that buy trucks are buy one or

two trucks and they all drive their own

truck okay

second testicle great strategy again

think about your own company here a

distinctive value chain if you if you

don't operate the business differently

your value chain isn't going to be real

you've got to have a different operating

model that aligns with your positioning

okay so if we take a KO and I won't go

through this if you look at how they

operate their their company compared to

all the other companies in their

industry they do it differently they

have a different value chain their

stores look different their customer

service looks different their logistics

looks different and it's all aligned

with that value proposition they're

their breakthrough idea was that they

wouldn't that they sell a fully assemble

furniture they send both parts they sell

parts in a box so when you go to Ikea

you buy you walk out with a box in which

there are the parts of the furniture you

just bought and you get the opportunity

to actually take the furniture home

yourself you don't get somebody with a

van you know delivering dropping off

completed furniture at your house IKEA

understood that that was that was good

most a lot of customers liked that but

the customers they liked they wanted to

serve who was very price-sensitive

they were willing to deliver themselves

they would they would deliver their own

furniture and by by doing it that way

and by also having inbound logistics in

not entire sofas but the parts for a

sofa in a box they save huge amounts of

logistical costs and they took that

savings and they passed it on to the

customer in terms of much lower price

but the customer then had to put the

furniture together themselves

I have a daughter one of my daughters

happens to love this company and I had

the privilege of helping her you know

renting a car when I visited her in

college so that we could take the box

home for my cat I went to I came any

times and and then you have to take the

box home and then you have a you know

then you get to put it together it's

like somebody's birthday you have to put

together the birthday present in our or

Christmas it's like putting together the

toys and you know that that could be fun

I frankly found it very tedious I have a

lot of fun doing it but my daughter

really liked this company the value

proposition worked for her it didn't

actually work for me in fact I pretty

much hated every minute I was in that

store I didn't like the service there is

no service I organized the store so you

get lost and you can't get out when

you're checking out you have to go to

this these big huge racks and and and

you have to pull down the box of what

you're buying it slept the Box you know

to the check-in counter and pay your

bill and then you have to take the box

out and load it in your car and then you

have to drag the box up to the apartment

of your daughter in my case and then you

get to spend 30 or 40 minutes trying to

figure out how to put the thing together

not a good idea for me my daughter loved

it it was it met her needs for

reasonable price they have very nicely

designed products and style products

very Scandinavian but they're very low

cost they're really high quality really

low cost at work for her and this tells

you something very important about

strategy and that is that one of the

things a great strategy does is it

doesn't please every customer

if you're trying to please every

customer you don't have a strategy a

good strategy makes some customers

unhappy if every customer is happy

you're in trouble if every possible

customer in the industry likes what

you're doing then the odds are that

you'll never really be successful

strategy is funding about choosing who

exactly you are trying to please and

then engineering a value chain in order

to deliver on that here's here's PACCAR

you know another critical part of a

successful tragedy is the concept of

trade-offs a trade-off is where in order

to deliver one benefit you give up on

another benefit and that's what I can

did you know they to get that really low

price of nicely styled furniture and in

order to do that you had to go through

an awkward experience in the store you

had to take the product home to yourself

and you had to put it together yourself

and that was a trade-off that they were

willing to make because they understood

that's what their customers really that

was the trade up they wanted to make

strategies about choice about choosing

what you want to do but one of the

phrases that I said at some point and I

found has been very powerful is the

essence of strategy is what you choose

not to do it's the service you don't

offer it's the functions you don't

provide it's the benefit you don't offer

that's the essence of strategy if you

can be clear about that that's a good

sign that you can be clear about your

overall strategy okay so time is very

short but in terms of a successful

strategy

we've got to connect the dots across the

value chain you got to make sure the

service connects with the way we mark it

connects with our kind of product value

proposition the pieces fit together

across the value chain and there's

continuity you can't be changing

strategy all the time it takes like two

three years to implement a strategy

because you got to get all those pieces

aligned around what your what your

ultimate position is and continuity

becomes crucial okay again you can look

at some of these examples and talk about

it even further when we think about

strategy one of the things that I you

know I find very helpful to think about

and might be helpful for you is what

kind of competition are we creating in

our industry and and the wrong answer is

we're creating a zero-sum competition

we're all doing the same thing beating

each other up on price that's not the

competition we want but we want to

create is really more of a positive some

competition where we're all have a

different strategy we're all try to do

something a little bit different we're

serving different customers we're trying

to meet different needs that's the kind

of competition we want that's the

competition we're actually the whole

industry can be more attractive and

competitors can do well in terms of

corporate strategy again I've already

covered the idea that there's multiple

levels if you're in a very large group

there might be a third level there might

be groups of businesses clumped together

because the old company the whole

company has so many businesses that can

manage it you've got to clump it into

groups so there might be a level of

group strategy you know what are the key

questions of corporate level strategy

first of all understanding what

different businesses you're in becomes

really critical

because you need a strategy for each

distinct business and sometimes

companies get confused in fact what I

find is usually you think of your

business too broadly you'll realize that

actually the truck industry is not one

industry there's heavy trucks and light

trucks and those are totally different

businesses so you know key question for

corporate strategy is sorting out what

the different businesses are do we have

the right portfolio is each business

attractive in and of itself and then the

businesses are we the best owner for the

business does the business reinforce

each other do we have synergy is there a

logic for how the businesses fit

together and so on ok this is kind of

these are the key questions of corporate

level strategy it's a different animal

it builds on business strategy but it's

different all the way in corporate

strategy we're trying to create

synergies across businesses if there's

no synergies we're probably better off

you know selling it because we're not

going to be able to add any value and

this just talks about the kind of

synergies that we might be pursuing and

we got to make sure they're real we've

got to make sure they're actually

meaningful they're not just a little

benefit but they're big deal you know

here's the ultimate synergy company

Disney that that has many many different

businesses but they're all united in a

common positioning basic value

proposition they're sharing lots of

resources like characters and and and

and and you know video properties and so

forth leveraging across all these

businesses and this company has been

remarkably robust in a very unstable

industry where where some years you make

a good film then actually make a lousy

film people go up and down but

he has a real robust corporate strategy

that's given them a lot of resilience

over time and then I guess let me finish

up this session by talking about well

what's our job as leaders in strategy

and what I found is that the head of a

business unit

you know ant and the CEO of the overall

corporation ultimately you have to be

the chief strategist the reason is that

nobody else has the right perspective

for strategy except the ultimate leader

everybody down in the organization is

thinking about their part of the company

their business their function the

marketing department the production

department the R&D the only person that

really has the true strategy perspective

is the person that's actually running

the overall business so you've got to

use your people to get information

you've got to make it a team process but

also you have to decide strategy can't

be a popularity contest where everybody

gets a vote because essence of strategy

is about choices and we've got to make

one clear set of choices we can't we

can't have sort of oh well we'll do this

and we'll do this and we'll do this and

we'll do this

oh yes marketing I know you want to do

this we'll do a little bit of that to

end up in you're not going to do well

you're not going to have a strategy you

as the CEO got to make sure that you

have a great strategy process

you got to make sure that person all

you've got the right business units

organized and they got a yacht you got a

great team working on a strategy for

each of those business units you got it

you got to make sure they're answering

the right questions you shouldn't ask

the question of how much is the industry

going to grow for the next ten years and

think that's the key question that's one

of other key questions every strategy

has to address the industry where do we

stand today how would we benchmark our

performance across the value chain who

is a competitor our key competitors how

are they doing where they stand what are

their value chains look like there's a

lot of key questions in a good strategy

and know the only person is going to

make sure you have the right questions

is you because you're the person that's

actually in charge of pulling it

together and making the choices at the

end of the day you know you got to make

sure the right are involved in the

strategy process you know that's your

job as a leader and what we know is

strategy has to be done collectively by

the multi functional team with its

strategy to each functional department

and let them do the production strategy

and the marketing strategy and the

service strategy that never works we've

got to get those people together doing

the strategy together because all those

pieces have to fit together you you know

there's no scent but marketing there's

only good marketing for a particular

strategy so we can't let the marketing

guys go running off and do good

marketing we've got to put their role in

the context of the overall positioning

we're trying to achieve in the market

that's that's what great strategy is all

about and guess whose job it is to make

sure that happens you the person who has

the overall holistic perspective of the

business

ah you know your board of directors we

found you need to have let your Board of

Directors see the strategy before they

have to approve it board of directors

want to participate in the process now

it's not their job to develop a strategy

but they're usually smart people and

it's very helpful to get their input and

then you can come back to them with your

what you want them to approve and as

long as they've been part of the process

and felt like they got some ownership in

the process they're going to be really

comfortable but if you just show up one

day and say here's my strategy everybody

vote yes then you're going to you're

going to erode your capital with the

board and you're going to need the board

to support you because every company has

ups and downs and you need the board to

be there and understand what are you

doing and how you're doing it and so

that when things go wrong they don't

panic

and if the stock price goes down they

don't freak out a great strategy need

the commitment of the board the

awareness of the board the understanding

of the board and so how to bring them

into the process without them thinking

they do it you know that's your job as a

leader and depending on your company and

and how serious your issue issues are

you've got to calibrate how much you

want to play directly in the process

versus kind of sort of overseeing the

process and and that really depends on

the situation you know if you got a real

turnaround you're going to have to lead

the whole process if you if you come in

in a really bad situation you're just

got to lead the whole thing don't

delegate it to strategic planning but

you know here is pre stable company

you've got a good team then your job is

really to set the right process up and

then check in and see how they're doing

one of the things we've learned I've

done a lot I've trained now probably you

know 350 of

top seat in the world they come to

Harvard for a bootcamp we call it the

new CEO workshop and when a CEO gets

appointed we invite them and we have

about a dozen you know two or three

times a year come together as a group

and we go through you know okay what do

you have to do to be a successful CEO

and we know a lot about that and we go

through that process and one of the

things we we do in that workshop is we

we talk a lot about why a great leader

doesn't want to have to reject the work

of his team or her team and the worst

thing you want to have to reject is the

strategic plan people do a lot of work

they think very hard to get themselves

all excited and they come together with

a great plan and they're presented to

you the worst thing that you have to do

is say no because if you reject that

plan first of all it's a reflection that

you created a lousy process the wrong

people the wrong questions it's also a

sign that you didn't check in to see if

they were moving in the right direction

you want to make sure that they're

thinking the right way they're on the

right path encourage them that you know

don't do it for them but but check in

what you want to do in a strategy

process is you want to be really happy

and say that's a great work that's great

work and then you're going to motivate

your team to really be responsible and

to really move the business forward but

if you reject their strategy because you

didn't really pay much attention to what

they were doing and you just you're just

having the meeting you know at the end

of six months then what's going to

happen you're going to have to do it

every one of your team is always going

to want you to approve anything before

they do too much work on it they're

going to create dependence on you as the

leader so as a leader one of your most

critical jobs is to

essentially create the right processes

to allow your team to succeed and check

in so so that if people get off on the

wrong track that you're not comfortable

with you don't have to reject their work

at the end what you want to do is the

CEO is going to celebrate the work of

your team you want to celebrate the

strategy that they've come up with that

you're that you're comfortable with

because you were you were there and you

orchestrated the process and you checked

in and you gave feedback and and and the

group learned and and here we are with

something great that's what strategic

leadership is all about at your level

the people most of you in this room are

at that level ok so that is I think for

me anyway from doing this many many

times still every year this is kind of

the fundamental ideas that I think we

all have to really understand and then

turn into reality if we're going to have

a great strategy so Amit I guess we have

some time for some Q&A so let's open the

up but these slides will post you know

they'll be available to you you can go

into the details there many more that

you can access through the by websites

and other other materials but but

ultimately at the end of the day there's

no nothing more important in building a

really world-class company than getting

this stuff right so man thank you better

go

haha
