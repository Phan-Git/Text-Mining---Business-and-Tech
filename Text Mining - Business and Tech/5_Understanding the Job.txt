hi my name's clay Christensen I'm a

professor

Business School I brought with me a set

of puzzles all related to innovation

we decided that the way we teach

marketing is at the core of what makes

motivation difficult to achieve the most

helpful way we've thought of it so far

is that we actually hire products to do

things for us and understanding what job

we have to do in our lives for which we

would hire a product is really the key

to cracking this problem of motivating

customers to buy what we're offering so

I wanted just to tell you a story about

a project we did for one of the big fast

food restaurants they were trying to

Goose up the sales of their milkshakes

they had just studied this problem up

the Gazoo they brought in customers who

fit the profile of the quintessential

milkshake consumer and they give them

samples and asked could you tell us how

we can improve our milkshake so you'd

buy more of them do you want a

chocolatier cheap or chunky or chewy or

they get very clear feedback they would

then improve the milkshake on those

dimensions and it had no impact on sales

or profits whatsoever so one of our

colleagues went in with a different

question on his mind and that was I

wonder what job arises in people's lives

that caused them to come to this

restaurant to hire a milkshake so we

stood in a restaurant for 18 hours one

day and just took very careful data what

time did they buy these milkshakes what

were they wearing were they alone did

they buy other food with it did they eat

it in the restaurant or drive off with

it it turned out that nearly half of the

milkshakes were sold before 8 o'clock in

the morning the people who bought them

were always alone it was the only thing

they bought and they all got in the car

and drove off with it so to figure out

what job they were trying to hire it to

do we came back the next day and stood

outside the restaurant so we could

confront these folks as they left the

milkshake in hand and in language that

they could understand we essentially

asked excuse me please but I got to sort

this puzzle out what job were you trying

to do for yourself that caused you to

come here and hire that milkshake and

they'd struggle to answer so we didn't

help them

asking other questions like well think

about the last time you were in the same

situation meeting to get the same job

done but you didn't come here to hire a

milkshake what did you hire and then as

we put all of their answers together it

became clear that they all had the same

job to do in the morning and that is

they had a long and boring drive to work

and they just needed something to do how

they drove to keep the commute

interesting one hand had to be on the

wheel

but somebody given him another hand and

there wasn't anything in it and they

just needed something to do while they

drove they weren't hungry yet but they

knew they'd be hungry by 10 o'clock so

they also wanted something that would

just pull down there and stay for their

morning good question what am I hire

when I do this job you know I've never

framed the question that way before but

last Friday I heard a banana to do the

job take my word for it never hire

bananas they're gone in three minutes

you're hungry by 7:30 if you promise not

to tell my wife I probably hire donuts

twice a week but they don't do it well

either they're gone fast they crumb all

over my clothes they get my fingers

gooey

sometimes I hire bagels but as you know

they're so dry and tasteless then I have

to steer the car with my knees while I'm

putting jam on them and then if the

phone rings we got that crisis I

remember I hired a Snickers bar once but

ah I felt so guilty I've never hired

Snickers again let me tell you when I

come here and hire this milkshake

it is so viscous that it easily takes me

20 minutes to suck it up that thin

little straw who cares what the

ingredients are I don't all I know is

I'm full all morning and it fits right

here in my cup holder well it turns out

that the milkshake does the job better

than any of the competitors which in the

customers minds are not burger king

milkshakes but it's bananas Donuts

bagels Snickers bars coffee and so on

but I hope you can see how if you

understand the job how to improve the

product becomes just obvious
