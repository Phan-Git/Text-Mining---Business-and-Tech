welcome to rise we are a global

community of thinkers and doers working

together with Barclays to create the

future of financial services we have

communities all over the world including

here in New York as well as in London

Manchester and Cape Town and we are

excited to soon be launching in Tel Aviv

Vilnius and Mumbai in each of these

communities we are working to connect

co-create and scale with some of the

world's most inspiring individuals today

we have the opportunity to sit down with

Professor Clayton Christensen of the

Harvard Business School

Clayton is the New York Times

bestselling author of several books

including the innovators dilemma which

first introduced the theory of

disruptive innovation more than 20 years

ago since that time Clayton's theories

and strategies have been utilized by

some of the world's most notable

companies to build their businesses

including Tata Procter and Gamble and

Intel Forbes and The Economist have

rated Clayton as one of the world's most

influential thinkers of our time it is

our great pleasure to sit down with

Clayton today and discuss the future of

financial services and the disruption

that is coming to our industry

clay welcome to rise New York so I

didn't be here things it's great it's

great to have you here and I we really

appreciate you taking the time today to

visit with a number of our Barclays

colleagues as well as other thought

leaders here in in the FinTech

innovation space in New York obviously

disruption in financial services is a

major topic at the moment and to start

off would you give us your view of what

disruption means and how it's being

applied to financial services disruption

occurs when an innovating company

develops a product that is simpler and

more affordable than the prior products

or services in the marketplace and this

allows you to bring in populations of

people who previously didn't have the

money or the skill to participate in the

market now they can and so disruptive

innovations creates growth by enabling

more people to do things that previously

were in the realm of just the rich then

we call it disruptive because when this

occurs at this at the simple end of the

market the incumbent leaders find it

unattractive to go after them because

given the business model of the

incumbent they want to make better

products that they could sell for better

profits to their best customers

and when they look down it makes no

sense to go down there are a number of

new entrants into financial services

right we see Facebook Alibaba Amazon

Google and we also see a number of small

fin tech startups thousands really last

year there were more than 13,000 new fin

tech companies around the globe some are

becoming billion-dollar companies a lot

of the banks and big financial services

companies can't understand what the

relevance is of what's happening in this

market how they they should address

these these competitors so in order to

give a good answer I need to just

define a couple of concepts so in this

process of providing a service to a

client or in the Silicon Valley they

take this process of a set of steps and

they put it vertical and they call it a

stack okay well each step or each layer

in the stack there has to be a way they

interface with the adjacent players in

the stack and one way you could do it is

in an interdependent way and in an

interdependent connection if you change

one thing you have to change many other

things they're all interdependent that's

right and so it is very secure it's very

private

but innovation can't happen very rapidly

there because again you change one thing

you've got to change everything and you

have to be integrated you have to make

both sides of it in order to make the

interface work the other way to define

how things fit together this interface

is modular and that is we agree in

advance what each of us has to look like

so that when we put it together it just

works API is being the example right

yeah that's right so you don't have to

be integrated and a modular interface

can it makes is fast you can change one

thing without changing everything and so

innovation accelerates okay right and so

it's it's a paradox to some degree

because in a modular world it's fast but

you can't differentiate your products

from others because people can just copy

you so it's fast you don't make much

money and an interface an interdependent

interface you make money but it's slow

now historically my sense

is that in a bank you have the back end

of a bank where you do all of the

functional things that just have to

happen yeah it has to be there and it's

heavily regulated yes and then there are

business units in a bank that provide

various services or products and

historically the in the connection

between the services and the back end is

an interdependent connection meaning it

makes things slow right but that's where

you make money and then at the next

interface between the people that

provide the services and the customers

historically that has been in an open

modular interface so the customers have

to conform themselves to standards that

the bank sets right right and there are

good things about them the bad thing is

with the standard interface the clients

can leave because they know how to plug

themselves into lots of other banks too

you know right and I think what's

happening now is that new companies

offering services interact with the back

end by buying a bank and Google has done

this there's one in Salt Lake City

called web Bank there's another one it's

called the Bank Corporation you know all

building api's for banking basically

right that's right yeah that modular

component that's right and it's a

modular component so the service

provider can optimize what they're doing

and it plugs into the backend and then

the interface with the customer is

interdependent and proprietary so find

the Lending Club I loan you some money

and a small amount but I'm going to

watch how well you Eddie it how do you

manage that money and do you pay him

back on time and just like an uber you

get five stars if they did a good job

they rate each other the provider right

and the customer and how well is he

doing and if you get a five along you

more money next time you know and yes

and so the interface between you and me

the provider becomes very proprietary

yes it's just the interface is you you

and I yes and it's very hard for you to

leave correct because because you've got

the relationship with that go with that

customer right right right but the back

end is somewhat irrelevant to the

customer isn't it that's right

that's right it just needs to be a

module that's right and so regulation

happens there on the back end because

that is regulated but you know by the

laws interface there means that the

people who are providing the services

are able to innovate without regulation

right and barclays just have to has has

to be sure that they play where it the

interface the interdependent interface

is between them and the customer they

want to own that customer but they don't

necessarily need to be all of the

modules that's right and so does this

lead us to a model where a bank becomes

a platform that startups could create

new enterprises on top of but then they

layer into the customer through the bank

that's right so the bank continues to

own the customer but the startups create

products that bolt on to the modules the

bank is created yeah that's interesting

and do you think that large financial

services companies like Barclays as an

example can do this from with inside

their business can they disrupt

themselves internally no and the problem

is that disruption begins before the

core business is

a lien okay and so if you try to address

the disruptive innovator from within the

core business it'll screw up a beautiful

business right yeah and yet if you wait

until the disruption is has progressed

and now the core business is ailing then

the game is over and that's why you have

to do the new one in parallel in

parallel with the old one not in series

now why why do big companies typically

fight against that model because you

don't see a lot of big financial

services companies creating brand-new

business units yeah they're trying to

disrupt themselves from inside of their

business right what is it that works

against that model accounting because in

accounting you can measure the cost of

replicating all of the administrative

overhead in two different organizations

if you put them together you you

economize on those overhead

administrative costs right but what

accounting cannot account for is when

you put those two things together it

slows the innovation down to a turtle

base almost you know and and you and you

because you're slow you don't grow and

the loss of growth and the slowness of

administrative consolidation the

accountants can't account for that yes

and so what they give you is a very

skewed view of what's best for the

company right so from a rational

perspective it doesn't necessarily make

sense to create a new business unit

because the metrics that you're using to

measure success on the other sides of

your business

don't measure up that's right going back

to this idea of modular business

structures let's just say

there are a lot of companies that are

creating accelerators programs for open

innovation where do these initiatives

fail and how can they succeed I view

what you're doing here is a research

facility you know and so you develop and

you type technology or a new business

idea if you then think that the core

business we ought to give these new

ideas to the core business to deploy

they either will kill it or that they

will read it will formulate it so that

fits their business model okay and so to

think that doing this somehow

regenerates the business model is just a

non sequitur it was not designed to

change the business models designed to

do one thing very well and so in order

for this to work the people at the

highest level not in business units but

at the corporate level need to be in

very good touch with what's going on

here and when they see that when they

say they know there's a job needing to

be done it's going to work we will set

up a new business unit around that

business idea and we'll create new

business units and so the corporation

can change in significant ways by

creating new business units but they

can't change by trying to change the old

one it was designed it was designed not

to change interesting yeah it's

definitely true we see antibodies in

this organ in an organism that reject

new things naturally because they're

designed to protect and preserve and

grow the previous businesses and when we

look at the current market and the way

that executives who have to lead these

very big companies in financial services

through these challenging times the

natural response by many is to conserve

capital to invest in

efficiency innovation that takes cost

out of certain processes

what would the innovators dilemma teach

us about the short-term and long-term

gains of that strategy when the business

unit starts up the data that you use to

navigate yourself is data about the

context in which the job to be done

emerges and the data about that first

stage is passive data its data about the

context and the job to be done

there's no data about customers or

competitors or products and then in the

second stage where you're in making good

products better there the data is all

about revenues and competitors and

customers and features and distribution

and it is so strong that data that you

start to think that this the structure

of the world is organized by products

rather than job to be done yes because

again the job to be done

doesn't broadcast at high fidelity data

about the job and so for the manager

they're just world up into another world

of data about the products and customers

and markets and then has that product

becomes mature and innovation has to be

efficiency innovations there the

language becomes the language of numbers

and the data that you're looking for is

return on investment

Rhona IRR and and those are the right

metrics for that era and the managers

who run that business have a language of

numbers so in each of these three realms

the language that they use is different

and the metrics that you use to measure

success

and what kill kills you I mean there are

a lot of things that killed us but one

of the most important ones is that the

people who are in the mature parts of

the business where the metrics are again

Rhona IRR at MPV which are the right

measures there when they try to impose

that on new companies that are emerging

where the data needs to be about the

context it just kills it

and it's actually quite hard for the

people on top to say oh this business is

one of these and therefore I'm going to

put in an app in my brain which is this

is the way you measure success you know

and then the next is one of those that

take that app and put that in and I will

speak the language of that one that is

rare they have to be not bilingual but

try doing lingual they're interesting

great well thank you very much for your

time and we look forward to welcoming

you back to rise New York Thanks so if I

can come back all right
